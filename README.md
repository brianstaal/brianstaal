- 👋 Hi, I’m @brianstaal, and I work as a professionel backend developer in the C#, MS SQL world. :)
- 👀 I’m interested in retrocomputing, Arduino, Rasperry PI & Home automation (IOT)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Arduino from scratch
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate with anyone at the moment, but maybe that will come.
- 📫 How to reach me - hmm, I think you will find out if you really want to....
